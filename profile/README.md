# The Gang-of-Fork

Hi there! We are the Gang-of-Fork, four students from the DHBW Mannheim.
In this organization we bundle all the repositories we create during our university lectures our in our free time.

Feel free to check everything out, although not all existing repositories are currently public.

The highlights include the odatafy framework consisting of odatafy-parser, odatafy-mongodb and odatafy-mongodb-example as well as the peer-to-peer marketplace consisting of p2p-marketplace-backend and p2p-marketplace-frontend.

Enjoy!
